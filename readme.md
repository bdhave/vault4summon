>**WARNING: the current code was only tested with a Hashicorp Vault Server in development mode.
It must therefore be considered as a Proof of Concept, and it is not intended to be used in production
until [issue 1](https://github.com/bdhave/vault4summon/issues/1#issue-798122084) is  closed**

## Quick start

* Get vault4summon
  * Download it or build it if you have a Go compiler or use [Nix](useNix4Go.md) to create your Go environment.
* Install
  * Install [Summon][summon website] if you don't have it already installed
  * Copy `vault4summon` to `/usr/local/lib/summon/`
* Configure
  * Set the [environment variables](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands#environment-variables)
    to access Hashicorp Vault. vault4summon supports same environment variables as 'vault kv get' command.
    * `VAULT_ADDR`: e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8200/.
    * `VAULT_TOKEN`: e.g. 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
* Create a [secrets.yml](secrets.yml) file
* Use [Summon][summon website]
## Summon provider contract

Providers for Summon are easy to write. Given the identifier of a secret, they either return its value or an error.

There is the contract:

* They take one and only one argument, the identifier of a secret (a string). The argument can also be a flag with value
  -v or --version. The provider must return his version on stdout.

* If retrieval is successful, they return the value on stdout with exit code 0.

* If an error occurs, they return an error message on stderr with a non-0 exit code.

* The default path for providers is /usr/local/lib/summon/. If one provider is in that path, summon will use it. If
  multiple providers are in the path, you can specify which one to use with the --provider flag, or the environment
  variable SUMMON_PROVIDER. If your providers are placed outside the default path, give summon the full path to them.

* Variable IDs are used as identifiers for fetching Secrets. These are made up of a secret name (required) and secret
  key path (optional).

The Vault CLI to retrieve a secret is

`vault kv get -field=mysecretkeypath secret/name`

This provider has 2 implemented formats for Variable ID:

* secret/name#mysecretkeypath as used
  by [AWS Secrets Manager provider][AWS-summon]
* secret/name/mysecretkeypath as used
  by [Keepass kdbx database file provider][Keepass] or [Gopass provider][Gopass]

So the two commands below return the same value

`
summon --provider vault4summon --yaml 'hello: !var secret/name#mysecretkeypath' printenv hello
`

`
summon --provider vault4summon --yaml 'hello: !var secret/name/mysecretkeypath' printenv hello
`
