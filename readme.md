You can find the latest version of the licence [here](https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/european-union-public-licence-eupl_en).

**WARNING: the current code was only tested with a Hashicorp Vault Server in development mode.**

**It must therefore be considered as a Proof of Concept and it is not intended to be used in production until issue 1 is closed**

## Summon provider contract
Providers for Summon are easy to write. Given the identifier of a secret, they either return its value or an error.

There is the contract:

* They take one and only one argument, the identifier of a secret (a string).
The argument can also be a flag with value -v or --version. The provider must return his version on stdout.

* If retrieval is successful, they return the value on stdout with exit code 0.

* If an error occurs, they return an error message on stderr with a non-0 exit code.

* The default path for providers is /usr/local/lib/summon/. If one provider is in that path, summon will use it. If multiple providers are in the path, you can specify which one to use with the --provider flag, or the environment variable SUMMON_PROVIDER. If your providers are placed outside the default path, give summon the full path to them.

* Variable IDs are used as identifiers for fetching Secrets. These are made up of a secret name (required) and secret key path (optional).

The Vault CLI to retrieve a secret is

`vault kv get -field=mysecretkeypath secret/name`

This provider are 2 implemented formats for Variable ID:
* secret/name#mysecretkeypath as sed by [AWS Secrets Manager provider](https://github.com/cyberark/summon-aws-secrets)
* secret/name/mysecretkeypath as used by [Keepass kdbx database file provider](https://github.com/mskarbek/summon-keepass)


So the two commands below return the same value

`
summon --provider vault4summon  --yaml 'hello: !var secret/name#mysecretkeypath' printenv hello
`

`
summon --provider vault4summon  --yaml 'hello: !var secret/name/mysecretkeypath' printenv hello
`
